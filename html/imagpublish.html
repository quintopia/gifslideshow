%% Making a Slideshow GIF
% Our goal here is to take a sequence of somewhat similar images and create
% a slideshow in which the most similar parts of the image have been
% aligned. We can do this with the tools |create_animation_stack| and
% |write_animation_stack|.
%% Importing and Preparing Source Images
% First, import a sequence of RBG images. Here, I have already imported
% night1 through night6. These images do not need to have the same
% dimensions, but they should all have been taken at about the same time
% and from the about the same place. It is fine if the camera changes
% orientation between shots. For instance compare night1 with night6:

imshow(imresize(night1,0.3));
%%
imshow(imresize(night6,0.3));
%%
% It is best if these images already have approximately the same histogram.
% If some of the images have very bright or very dark spots that the other
% images don't have (or, in particular, which the image that frames the
% scene in the way you most prefer does not have), it is best to crop these
% parts of the image out in advance. Speaking of which, this process
% requires the images be in a cell array, where the first element is the
% image which has the desired point of view. I prefer the framing of
% night6.

seq = {night6,night5,night4,night3,night2,night1};

%% Registering and Overlapping the Images
% The remainder of this process is incredibly easy, since the tools do all
% the heavy lifting. First, we need to register the images and overlay them
% with the first image in the sequence. Since the images are so small,
% we'll bleed the edges of the image parts into one another by only 5
% pixels. This step may take a minute, so go grab a snack while you wait.
seq = create_animation_stack(seq,5);
%% Create the Slide Show and Save it to a GIF
% We want to save a slide show of these aligned images to a GIF.
% First, note that this process will create very large files if the source 
% images are very large. So let's make these images much smaller.

for i=1:6
    seq{i}=imresize(seq{i},0.1);
end
%%
% Actually creating the file is easy, but some more decisions must be made
% here: should the slide show loop? Should consecutive images dissolve into
% each other? How slow should the dissolve be? How long should each image
% be displayed? Here, we'll allow the slideshow to loop forever, with each
% image being displayed for 1.5 seconds and spending 10 tenths of a second
% dissolving from one image into the next. We'll save the result to
% night.gif.
write_animation_stack(fliplr(seq), 'night.gif', 10, 1.5, 1);

%% Single Image Action Shot
% It is also possible to layer all these images into a single image using
% |action_shot|, though this will require much more user input. Call it
% with arguments like those you used for |create_animation_stack|, and then 
% select the part of each image you want to to preserve in the final by 
% drawing polygons around them. The tighter you make the polygons around
% the parts you wish to preserve, the better the final result will
